# shell-agent-samples

This repository has examples that you can use as a template to build out your shell agents. What is a shell agent you ask? The shell agent allows you to schedule test runs from qTest and execute a shell script on your test machine on that schedule. All the data needed to know what tests were scheduled, and for what project, will be available to the shell script. For more documentation on how the shell agent works, please see our support site here:

This repository will grow over time with more examples. If you would like to contribute one, reach our to us on our support site: https://support.qasymphony.com/hc/en-us/requests/new

Alternatively, just submit a pull request and we'll take a look at it!

Over time, QAS will add more samples to demonstrate various functionality.

### Structure

Each folder will contain it's own ReadMe for how to use the contained scripts along with the shell agent.
